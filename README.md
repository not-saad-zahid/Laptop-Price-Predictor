# Laptop Price Predictor

Laptop Price Predictor is a machine learning project designed to predict the price of a laptop based on its specifications. By leveraging data-driven models, this tool helps users estimate the fair market value of laptops, assisting both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

## Features

- Predicts laptop prices using key features such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, graphics, display, and more.
- User-friendly interface for entering laptop specifications.
- Provides quick and accurate price estimations.
- Built using Python and popular machine learning libraries.
- Easily extendable for additional features or new datasets.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection:** The model is trained on a dataset of laptop specifications and prices.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Important features are extracted and processed for optimal model performance.
3. **Model Training:** Machine learning algorithms are used to train a regression model to predict prices.
4. **Prediction:** Enter laptop details and receive a price prediction instantly.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/not-saad-zahid/Laptop_Price_Predictor.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the application:**
   - For a script or CLI:
     ```bash
     python laptop.py
     ```
   - For a web app (if available):
     ```bash
     streamlit run laptop.py
     ```
